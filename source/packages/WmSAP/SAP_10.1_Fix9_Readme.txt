5.0 Platform Support

Same platforms as product release.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

Software AG recommends disabling all RFC connections and listeners, and ending 
all pending SAP processing before installing or uninstalling the fix. 

If webMethods Adapter for SAP is configured as a CTS server, you must either 
stop all connected CTS clients or disable their RFC connections and listeners 
before installing or uninstalling the fix on the CTS server. The CTS clients 
must be at the same fix level as the webMethods Adapter for SAP configured as a 
CTS server.



7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include 
enhancements to existing functionality and features. Any of these items can 
result in new or changed built-in services, APIs, or configuration parameters. 
Review the fix contents carefully before installing the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the 
release.

WSP-1522
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the RFC listeners are sometimes not enabled during
adapter startup and remain in the Failed status, in Integration Server 10.7 and
higher, if the SAP JCo library version 3.1.4 or 3.1.5 is installed.

This issue is now resolved. 

WSP-1518
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the endDate and startDate input parameters of 
the pub.sap.transaction:list public service are ignored, if the values are not
provided in the "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS z" format with decimal point and
decimal places.

This issue is now resolved.

The decimal point and decimal places are bypassed for the endDate and startDate
input parameters of the pub.sap.transaction:list service.

WSP-1505
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the automatic sharing of a single repository
connection between RFC connections to the same SAP system may result in metadata
access exceptions, if the default user of one of the RFC connections does not have
the required metadata access rights in SAP.

This issue is now resolved.

If the property watt.sap.strictDefaultUserCheck is set to true, the adapter checks
the metadata access rights of the default user before an RFC connection is enabled.
The RFC connection cannot be enabled if the default user does not have the required
access rights.

Alternatively, you can set a dedicated repository user for an RFC connection using
the 'Repository User Name' and 'Repository Password' properties. All RFC and IDoc
metadata access calls are then executed with the repository user. All other
non-metadata RFC calls are executed with the default user. 

WSP-1503 
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the CSRF token must not be visible in the hyperlink
when you enable the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) guard in Integration Server.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1460 (SAP_10.1_Fix6)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, on installing JCo 3.1.3 and higher, the SNC
enabled connections with user/password authentication cannot be enabled.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1443 (SAP_10.1_Fix6)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the user is unable to enable the connection if
the property watt.art.connection.byPassConnValidation is set to true and SAP
system is unavailable during Integration Server startup.

This issue is now resolved. 

WSP-1433 (SAP_10.1_Fix6)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the user exit service, sample.sap.idoc.Mappings:ordrsp
throws a NullPointerException for inbound IDocs of message type ORDRSP.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1415 (SAP_10.1_Fix6)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the user token $MYSAPSSO2$ cannot be set as the
default user for an RFC client connection.

This issue is now resolved.

The user token $MYSAPSSO2$ can be set as the default user.
The password for this default user is a base64-encoded SSO logon ticket. 

WSP-1412 (SAP_10.1_Fix6)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, internal references to closed Integration Server 
sessions are not always deleted and may cause memory exhaustion.

This issue is now resolved. 

WSP-1364 (SAP_10.1_Fix6)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, Test Connection button is introduced.
Test Connection button can be used to test the connection while creating or editing 
a connection. This feature is only available on Integration Server 10.7 and higher. 

WSP-1396 (SAP_10.1_Fix5)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the throughput performance logging does not work
with SAP JCo version 3.1.3 and later.
 
If you install SAP JCo middleware version 3.1.3 and if watt.sap.throughput is
set to true, then webMethods SAP Adapter 10.1 displays the error message
"java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError".
 
This issue is now resolved. The adapter now supports throughput logging with
SAP JCo version 3.1.3 and later. 

WSP-1327 (SAP_10.1_Fix5)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, 2 metadata entries, build and subsystem are
required in manifest.v3 file of WmSAP package for the SPM Plugin to work
correctly. These metadata entries are not getting added if WmSAP package is
loaded partially.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1323 (SAP_10.1_Fix5)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, autocomplete property for the password fields is
enabled in the Integration Server Administrator page of the adapter.
 
The password fields with autocomplete property enabled is a security
vulnerability.
 
The issue is now resolved.

WSP-1320 (SAP_10.1_Fix5)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the warning "Second directory could not be created"
appears in the server logs for a few transactions under high transaction traffic.
The message appears because the path of the second directory is not correct in
the logging logic of the transaction store.

This issue is resolved.

WSP-1297 (SAP_10.1_Fix4)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, Cloud Container environment is unable to load the
JavaScript files for the Admin User Interface due to an invalid file extension.

This issue is resolved. Now, the file extension has been changed.

WSP-1293 (SAP_10.1_Fix4)
webMethods SAP Adapter 10.1 does not support the registration of an RFC Listener
at multiple SAP Gateways.

SAP JCo 3.1 introduces a new feature which allows the automatic registration of
RFC Listeners at several SAP Gateway instances to achieve high availability and
to improve load balancing. The webMethods SAP Adapter 10.1 needs to be enhanced
to use this new JCo feature for RFC Listeners.

This issue is now resolved. The adapter now supports the automatic registration
of an RFC Listener at multiple SAP Gateway instances.

WSP-1281 (SAP_10.1_Fix4)
webMethods SAP Adapter 10.1 is not compatible with SAP JCo version
3.1.2 and later.

When you install SAP JCo middleware version 3.1.2 or later, then
webMethods SAP Adapter 10.1 fails to load with the following error message:
Error registering SAP Adapter with ART: WmSAP 10.1 requires SAP
JCo 3.0.18 (or higher) and is not compatible with earlier JCo
versions 2.x or 3.0.0 to 3.0.17.

This issue is resolved. The adapter is now compatible with SAP
JCo version 3.1.2 and later. 

WSP-1278 (SAP_10.1_Fix4)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the pub.sap.monitor.systat01:report service can
throw NullPointerExceptions when the connection attribute 'Log transaction status'
is set to the Off state for at least a single RFC Listener which is receiving
IDocs.

This issue is now resolved. The connection attribute 'Log transaction status'
is automatically enabled if an RFC Listener receives the IDocs.

WSP-1250 (SAP_10.1_Fix3)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the ALE notifications fail with Java type
mismatch exception after installing Fix1.

During runtime, the Java type and the ordering of IDoc segment field values are
different compared to the IDoc document specification. This causes Java type
mismatch exceptions.

This issue is now resolved. 

WSP-1232 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the enhanced SAP IDocLib 3.0.13 API is not
used to send the heterogenous IDoc lists.

This issue is resolved. The adapter now includes the pub.sap.client:sendIDocLists
service which allows sending multiple IDoc lists of different IDoc types in a
single tRFC transaction. 

WSP-1226 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the enhanced SAP IDocLib 3.0.13 API is not used
to improve the performance of IDoc inbound processing.

This issue is resolved. The adapter now uses SAP IDocLib 3.0.13 API to
increase the performance of the 
pub.sap.idoc:iDocToDocument and pub.sap.idoc:iDocToTables methods for large IDocs. 

WSP-1222 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the Return to Results link fails to retrieve the
results of the previous RFC function call with an exception.

This issue occurs when you execute an RFC function test in the adapter's Lookup
page and then click the Return to Results link in the table view to return to 
the results of the RFC function call.

This issue is now resolved. 

WSP-1218 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, Repository Server in the Listener page contains
duplicate options.

If two or more connections have the same connection alias, the Repository Server
contains duplicate options in the Listener page.

This issue is now resolved. 

WSP-1210 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the inbound request from SAP cannot be processed,
if the requests are sent using the bgRFC protocol.

This issue is resolved. Now, the adapter can process the inbound SAP requests
using the bgRFC protocol. 

WSP-1197 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the documentation is missing for Java IDoc API.

This issue is resolved. IDoc Java API documentation is now included in
Adapter for SAP. 

WSP-1196 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the processing of inbound IDocs and the execution
of the pub.sap.idoc:iDocToDocument service fails with the following exception-
com.wm.data.IData; cannot be cast to java.util.ArrayList

This issue is now resolved.  

WSP-1191 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, if the CIM type field is not set, then you must
create additional ALE notifications to process IDocs with CIM type extensions.

This issue is resolved. Now, setting an empty CIM type notification field to the
wildcard character (*) restores the runtime behavior of the adapter and allows
to process all IDocs with or without CIM type extension.

WSP-1165 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, if the default user of a master repository
connection does not have the necessary access rights in SAP, then specific
error log messages are not generated.

This issue can occur for the below situations:
- after a new RFC connection is created
- if there is a change in the startup order of RFC connections

The cause for this issue is when the default user of the connection does not have
necessary access rights in SAP and the connection becomes the master repository
connection for the other connections to the same SAP system.

This issue is resolved. Now, the adapter logs display a more descriptive error
message, if the default user does not have the necessary access rights in SAP. 

RGHADPESTBL-4599 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the home page is updated with minimal compliance 
with DELITE.
